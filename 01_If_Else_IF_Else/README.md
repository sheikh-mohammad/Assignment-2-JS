# Collection of `if-else if-else` Exercises

This directory contains a series of beginner-friendly JavaScript exercises. The main goal of these exercises is to understand and practice the use of `if-else if-else` conditional statements to solve various logical problems.

## Learning Objectives

-   Understand the basics of conditional logic.
-   Learn how to use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to control the flow of a program.
-   Get comfortable with comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`).
-   Practice taking user input using the `prompt()` function and displaying output to the console.

## Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
-   Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript syntax.
-   A text editor to view the code (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom).

## Projects Included

This collection features 10 small projects, each demonstrating a different use case for `if-else if-else` statements.

## How to Run Any Exercise

1.  **Navigate to a Project Folder**:
    Open the directory of the exercise you want to run (e.g., `01_Number_Check`).

2.  **Open the HTML File**:
    Double-click the `index.html` file inside the folder. This will open it in your default web browser.

3.  **Interact with the Prompt**:
    The page will show a prompt asking for input. Enter the required information (e.g., a number, your age).

4.  **View the Output**:
    -   Right-click on the page and select **"Inspect"** or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac) to open the developer tools.
    -   Click on the **"Console"** tab.
    -   The output of the script will be displayed there.

## What You'll Find in Each Folder

Each project folder is structured as follows:

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads the JavaScript code.
-   `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the `if-else if-else` logic.

This simple setup allows you to focus entirely on the JavaScript code and its behavior.
