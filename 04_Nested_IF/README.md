# Nested `if` Statement Exercises

This directory focuses on exercises that require the use of **nested `if` statements**. These are `if` statements placed inside other `if` or `else` blocks, allowing for more complex, multi-level conditional logic. These exercises demonstrate how to handle scenarios where a condition depends on the outcome of a prior condition.

## Learning Objectives

-   Understand the concept and syntax of nested `if` statements.
-   Learn how to create multi-layered logic to solve more intricate problems.
-   Practice evaluating conditions in a hierarchical manner.
-   Gain proficiency in structuring code for clarity when dealing with complex conditional flows.

## Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
-   A strong understanding of basic `if-else if-else` statements and logical operators (`&&`, `||`).
-   A text editor to view the code.

## Projects Included

This collection includes several projects to practice nested `if` logic.



| #   | Project Title                | Description                                                                                                |
| --- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Number Classification**    | Classifies a number first by its sign (Positive/Negative) and then by its parity (Even/Odd).               |
| 2   | **Age Group Classification** | Categorizes a person into Child, Teenager, Adult, or Senior Citizen using nested checks.                   |
| 3   | **Grade Classification**     | Assigns a grade (A, B, C, or Fail) with nested conditions for finer grading within a range.                |
| 4   | **Discount Eligibility**     | Determines a discount percentage based on a primary condition (purchase amount) and a secondary one (membership level). |
| 5   | **Voting Eligibility**       | Determines a person's voting eligibility based on their age and nationality.                               |
| 6   | **Scholarship Eligibility**  | Determines a student's eligibility for a scholarship based on their marks and family income.               |
| 7   | **Electricity Bill Calc.**   | Calculates the electricity tariff based on the number of units consumed and the time of day.               |
| 8   | **Login Authentication**     | Simulates a basic login authentication system using nested `if` statements.                                |
| 9   | **BMI Category Check**       | Calculates BMI and categorizes it as "Underweight", "Normal weight", or "Overweight".                    |
| 10  | **Job Eligibility**          | Determines a candidate's eligibility for different job positions based on their experience and skill level. |

## How to Run Any Implemented Exercise

1.  **Navigate to a Project Folder**:
    Open the directory of an exercise you want to run (e.g., `01_Number_Classification`).

2.  **Open the HTML File**:
    Double-click the `index.html` file inside the folder. This will open it in your default web browser.

3.  **Interact with the Prompt(s)**:
    The page will show one or more prompts asking for input. Enter the required information.

4.  **View the Output**:
    -   Right-click on the page and select **"Inspect"** or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac) to open the developer tools.
    -   Click on the **"Console"** tab.
    -   The output of the script will be displayed there.

## What You'll Find in Each Folder

Each project folder contains:

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads the JavaScript code.
-   `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the nested `if` logic.
