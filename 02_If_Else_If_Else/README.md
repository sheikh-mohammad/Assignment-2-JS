# Collection of `if-else if-else` Exercises (Set 2)

This directory expands on the concepts from the first set of exercises, introducing slightly more complex logical challenges. The goal is to solidify your understanding of `if-else if-else` statements and introduce logical operators like `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR).

## Learning Objectives

-   Reinforce the use of `if`, `else if`, and `else` for multi-condition scenarios.
-   Learn to combine conditions using logical operators (`&&`, `||`).
-   Solve problems involving more complex branching logic.
-   Continue practicing with user input and console output.

## Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
-   A solid understanding of the topics covered in the first set of `if-else` exercises.
-   A text editor to view the code (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom).

## Projects Included

This collection features 10 additional projects that build on the previous set.

## How to Run Any Exercise

1.  **Navigate to a Project Folder**:
    Open the directory of the exercise you want to run (e.g., `01_Number_Parity`).

2.  **Open the HTML File**:
    Double-click the `index.html` file inside the folder. This will open it in your default web browser.

3.  **Interact with the Prompt**:
    The page will show a prompt asking for input. Enter the required information (e.g., a year, a speed).

4.  **View the Output**:
    -   Right-click on the page and select **"Inspect"** or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac) to open the developer tools.
    -   Click on the **"Console"** tab.
    -   The output of the script will be displayed there.

## What You'll Find in Each Folder

Each project folder is structured as follows:

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads the JavaScript code.
-   `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the `if-else if-else` logic for the specific problem.

This simple setup allows you to focus entirely on the JavaScript code and its behavior.
