# JavaScript Assignment 2 - Techno Kids Batch 7

## Overview

This repository contains JavaScript assignments for the Techno Kids Batch 7 at Saylani Mass IT Training. The assignments focus on fundamental JavaScript concepts including conditional statements (if-else, if-else if-else, nested if), logical operators (AND, OR), and practical programming exercises.

## Assignments Breakdown

### 1. If-Else, If-Else If-Else Assignments
This section includes exercises that focus on basic conditional logic:
- **Number Check**: Determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero
- **Age Category**: Classify age groups (child, teenager, adult, senior)
- **Temperature Message**: Provide messages based on temperature values
- **Marks Grade System**: Calculate grades based on marks
- **Traffic Light System**: Simulate traffic light behavior
- **Day of Week**: Display messages based on the day of the week
- **Password Strength Checker**: Evaluate password strength
- **Electricity Bill**: Calculate electricity bills based on units consumed
- **BMI Category**: Determine BMI category based on weight and height
- **Exam Eligibility**: Check if a student is eligible for exams

### 2. If-Else If-Else Assignments
Advanced conditional statements with multiple conditions:
- **Number Parity**: Check if a number is even or odd
- **Leap Year Check**: Determine if a year is a leap year
- **Login Authentication**: Validate user login credentials
- **Grades**: Advanced grading system
- **Time of Day Greeting**: Display greetings based on time of day

### 3. If-Else If-Else with AND/OR Operators
Practical applications using logical operators to combine conditions.

### 4. Nested If Statements
Complex conditional logic using nested if statements to handle multiple criteria.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript
- Code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.)
- Modern web browser with developer console

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the specific assignment folder you want to work on
3. Open the JavaScript files in your preferred code editor
