# JavaScript Assignment 2 - Techno Kids Batch 7

## Overview

This repository contains JavaScript assignments for the Techno Kids Batch 7 at Saylani Mass IT Training. The assignments focus on fundamental JavaScript concepts including conditional statements (`if-else`, `if-else if-else`, nested `if`), and logical operators (`AND`, `OR`).

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of conditional logic in JavaScript.

-   [**01_If_Else_IF_Else**](./01_If_Else_IF_Else/README.md): Exercises focusing on basic `if-else if-else` statements.
-   [**02_If_Else_If_Else**](./02_If_Else_If_Else/README.md): Further practice with `if-else if-else` statements, introducing more varied scenarios.
-   [**03_If_Else_IF_Else_With_And_OR**](./03_If_Else_IF_Else_With_And_OR/README.md): Exercises demonstrating the use of logical `AND` (`&&`) and `OR` (`||`) operators within conditional statements.
-   [**04_Nested_IF**](./04_Nested_IF/README.md): Projects exploring complex conditional logic using nested `if` statements.

## Prerequisites

-   Basic understanding of JavaScript syntax and concepts.
-   A code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom).
-   A modern web browser with developer console access.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sheikh-mohammad/Assignment-2-JS.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Assignment-2-JS
    ```
3.  **Explore the Assignments**:
    Each numbered folder (`01_...`, `02_...`, etc.) contains a main `README.md` that provides an overview of the exercises in that section. Furthermore, every individual project folder (e.g., `01_Number_Check`) now includes its own detailed `README.md` with a code explanation, usage instructions, and examples.

## How to Use

To run any specific assignment:

1.  Navigate to the desired assignment's folder (e.g., `01_If_Else_IF_Else/01_Number_Check/`).
2.  For a detailed explanation of the code, open and read the `README.md` file in that folder.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
4.  Interact with any `prompt()` dialogs that appear.
5.  Open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`) to view the output of the JavaScript code.

## Learning Objectives

These assignments aim to teach and reinforce:

-   Fundamental conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`).
-   The application of logical operators (`&&`, `||`).
-   Structuring complex logic using nested conditional statements.
-   Practical problem-solving through JavaScript programming.
-   Interacting with users via `prompt()` and displaying results via `console.log()`.
