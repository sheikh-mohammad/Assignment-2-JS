It's a great example for beginners to understand how to use `if-else if-else` conditional statements to handle different cases based on user input.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Any Number:\". Type a number and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the output. The console will log whether the number is \"Positive number\", \"Negative number\", or \"Zero\".\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var num = +prompt(\"Enter Any Number:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter a number. The `+` sign before `prompt` converts the input string into a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks the value of `num`:\n    ```javascript\n    if (num > 0) {\n        console.log(\"Positive number\");\n    } else if (num < 0) {\n        console.log(\"Negative number\");\n    } else {\n        console.log(\"Zero\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   If `num` is greater than 0, it logs \"Positive number\".\n    -   If `num` is less than 0, it logs \"Negative number\".\n    -   Otherwise (if `num` is 0), it logs \"Zero\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `10`, the console will output:\n```\nPositive number\n```\nIf you enter `-5`, the console will output:\n```\nNegative number\n```\nIf you enter `0`, the console will output:\n```\nZero\n```\n",

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It's a practical example of using `if-else if-else` statements to handle multiple conditions.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Age:\". Type an age and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the output.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var age = +prompt(\"Enter Age:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter their age. The `+` sign converts the input string to a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks the `age` and prints the corresponding category:\n    ```javascript\n    if (age <= 12) {\n        console.log(\"Child\");\n    } else if (age <= 19) {\n        console.log(\"Teenager\");\n    } else if (age <= 59) {\n        console.log(\"Adult\");\n    } else if (age >= 60) {\n        console.log(\"Senior citizen\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   If the age is 12 or less, it logs \"Child\".\n    -   If the age is between 13 and 19, it logs \"Teenager\".\n    -   If the age is between 20 and 59, it logs \"Adult\".\n    -   If the age is 60 or more, it logs \"Senior citizen\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `10`, the console will output:\n```\nChild\n```\nIf you enter `18`, the console will output:\n```\nTeenager\n```\n",

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It's a simple way to practice `if-else if-else` statements for numerical ranges.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Temperature:\". Type a temperature (e.g., 25) and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the output message.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var temperature = +prompt(\"Enter Temperature:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter a temperature. The `+` sign converts the input string to a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks the `temperature` and logs a corresponding message:\n    ```javascript\n    if (temperature < 0) {\n        console.log(\"Freezing cold\");\n    } else if (temperature <= 15) {\n        console.log(\"Cold weather\");\n    } else if (temperature <= 30) {\n        console.log(\"Pleasant day\");\n    } else if (temperature > 30){\n        console.log(\"Hot day\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   If the temperature is below 0, it logs \"Freezing cold\".\n    -   If the temperature is between 0 and 15, it logs \"Cold weather\".\n    -   If the temperature is between 16 and 30, it logs \"Pleasant day\".\n    -   If the temperature is above 30, it logs \"Hot day\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `25`, the console will output:\n```\nPleasant day\n```\nIf you enter `-5`, the console will output:\n```\nFreezing cold\n```\n",

Based on the color of the traffic signal entered by the user (red, yellow, or green), it provides the appropriate instruction (\"Stop\", \"Get ready\", or \"Go\"). This is a great exercise for handling string comparisons with `if-else if-else`.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Signal Color (red, yellow, green):\". Type one of the colors and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the instruction.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var signalColor = prompt(\"Enter Signal Color (red, yellow, green):\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter a signal color. The input is stored as a string.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks the `signalColor` and logs the corresponding instruction:\n    ```javascript\n    if (signalColor == \"red\") {\n        console.log(\"Stop\");\n    } else if (signalColor == \"yellow\") {\n        console.log(\"Get ready\");\n    } else if (signalColor == \"green\") {\n        console.log(\"Go\");\n    } else {\n        console.log(\"Invalid signal\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   If the input is \"red\", it logs \"Stop\".\n    -   If the input is \"yellow\", it logs \"Get ready\".\n    -   If the input is \"green\", it logs \"Go\".\n    -   For any other input, it logs \"Invalid signal\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `red`, the console will output:\n```\nStop\n```\nIf you enter `green`, the console will output:\n```\nGo\n```\n",

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

Follow the instructions in the prompt or on the page.\n3.  The result will be logged to the browser's console.\n",

It's a straightforward example of mapping numerical inputs to string outputs using `if-else if-else`.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Number between 1 to 7:\". Type a number in this range and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the name of the day.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var day = +prompt(\"Enter Number between 1 to 7:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter a number. The `+` sign converts the input string to a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` chain checks the `day` number and logs the corresponding day name:\n    ```javascript\n    if (day == 1) {\n        console.log(\"Monday\");\n    } else if (day == 2) {\n        console.log(\"Tuesday\");\n    } else if (day == 3) {\n        console.log(\"Wednesday\");\n    } else if (day == 4) {\n        console.log(\"Thursday\");\n    } else if (day == 5) {\n        console.log(\"Friday\");\n    } else if (day == 6) {\n        console.log(\"Saturday\");\n    } else if (day == 7) {\n        console.log(\"Sunday\");\n    } else {\n        console.log(\"Invalid day\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   It checks the number from 1 to 7 and prints the corresponding day.\n    -   If the number is outside this range, it logs \"Invalid day\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `1`, the console will output:\n```\nMonday\n```\nIf you enter `5`, the console will output:\n```\nFriday\n```\n",

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It categorizes the password as \"Weak\", \"Moderate\", or \"Strong\". This is a practical example of using `if-else if-else` to provide feedback on user input.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Your Password:\". Type a password and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the password strength.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var password = prompt(\"Enter Your Password:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter a password, which is stored as a string.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks the `length` of the `password` string:\n    ```javascript\n    if (password.length < 6) {\n        console.log(\"Weak password\");\n    } else if (password.length <= 10) {\n        console.log(\"Moderate password\");\n    } else if (password.length > 10) {\n        console.log(\"Strong password\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   If the password has fewer than 6 characters, it's considered \"Weak\".\n    -   If the password has between 6 and 10 characters, it's \"Moderate\".\n    -   If the password has more than 10 characters, it's \"Strong\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `123`, the console will output:\n```\nWeak password\n```\nIf you enter `password123`, the console will output:\n```\nModerate password\n```\n",

It's a health-related application of `if-else if-else` logic.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Your BMI Value:\". Type your BMI value and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see your BMI category.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var bmi = +prompt(\"Enter Your BMI Value:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter their BMI value. The `+` sign converts the input to a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks the `bmi` value and logs the corresponding category:\n    ```javascript\n    if (bmi < 18.5) {\n        console.log(\"Underweight\");\n    } else if (bmi <= 24.9) {\n        console.log(\"Normal\");\n    } else if (bmi <= 29.9) {\n        console.log(\"Overweight\");\n    } else if (bmi > 30) {\n        console.log(\"Obese\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   A BMI less than 18.5 is \"Underweight\".\n    -   A BMI from 18.5 to 24.9 is \"Normal\".\n    -   A BMI from 25 to 29.9 is \"Overweight\".\n    -   A BMI of 30 or more is \"Obese\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `22`, the console will output:\n```\nNormal\n```\nIf you enter `31`, the console will output:\n```\nObese\n```\n"

It provides different messages for eligibility, a warning, or ineligibility, making it a practical use case for `if-else if-else`.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Ente Your Attendance Percentage:\". Type the attendance percentage and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the eligibility status.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var attendPercent = +prompt(\"Ente Your Attendance Percentage:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter their attendance percentage. The `+` sign converts the input to a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks the `attendPercent` and logs the appropriate message:\n    ```javascript\n    if (attendPercent >= 75) {\n        console.log(\"Eligible for exam\");\n    } else if (attendPercent >= 60) {\n        console.log(\"Warning: Attend more classes\");\n    } else if (attendPercent < 60) {\n        console.log(\"Not eligible for exam\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   If attendance is 75% or higher, the student is \"Eligible for exam\".\n    -   If attendance is between 60% and 74%, the student receives a \"Warning: Attend more classes\".\n    -   If attendance is below 60%, the student is \"Not eligible for exam\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `80`, the console will output:\n```\nEligible for exam\n```\nIf you enter `65`, the console will output:\n```\nWarning: Attend more classes\n```\n",

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

The goal is to solidify your understanding of `if-else if-else` statements and introduce logical operators like `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR).\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n-   Reinforce the use of `if`, `else if`, and `else` for multi-condition scenarios.\n-   Learn to combine conditions using logical operators (`&&`, `||`).\n-   Solve problems involving more complex branching logic.\n-   Continue practicing with user input and console output.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n-   A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).\n-   A solid understanding of the topics covered in the first set of `if-else` exercises.\n-   A text editor to view the code (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom).\n\n## Projects Included\n\nThis collection features 10 additional projects that build on the previous set.\n\n| #   | Project Title             | Description                                                                                   |\n| --- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1   | **Number Parity**         | Checks if a number is even, odd, or zero.                                                     |\n| 2   | **Leap Year Check**       | Determines if a given year is a leap year using the defining rules.                           |\n| 3   | **Login Authentication**  | Simulates a basic login system by checking a username and password.                           |\n| 4   | **Grades**                | Assigns a grade (A, B, C, or Fail) based on marks, with different thresholds.                 |\n| 5   | **Time of Day Greeting**  | Greets the user with \"Good Morning,\" \"Good Afternoon,\" or \"Good Evening\" based on the hour.    |\n| 6   | **Discount Eligibility**  | Calculates a discount percentage based on the total purchase amount.                          |\n| 7   | **Speeding Ticket**       | Issues a speeding warning or a fine based on the driver's speed.                              |\n| 8   | **Number Range Check**    | Checks if a number falls within specific ranges (1-10, 11-20, 21-30).                         |\n| 9   | **Age Verification**      | Classifies a person as an \"Adult,\" \"Teenager,\" or \"Child\" based on their age.                 |\n| 10  | **Voting Eligibility**    | Determines if a person is eligible to vote, soon eligible, or not yet eligible.               |\n\n## How to Run Any Exercise\n\n1.  **Navigate to a Project Folder**:\n    Open the directory of the exercise you want to run (e.g., `01_Number_Parity`).\n\n2.  **Open the HTML File**:\n    Double-click the `index.html` file inside the folder. This will open it in your default web browser.\n\n3.  **Interact with the Prompt**:\n    The page will show a prompt asking for input. Enter the required information (e.g., a year, a speed).\n\n4.  **View the Output**:\n    -   Right-click on the page and select **\"Inspect\"** or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac) to open the developer tools.\n    -   Click on the **\"Console\"** tab.\n    -   The output of the script will be displayed there.\n\n## What You'll Find in Each Folder\n\nEach project folder is structured as follows:\n\n-   `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads the JavaScript code.\n-   `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the `if-else if-else` logic for the specific problem.\n\nThis simple setup allows you to focus entirely on the JavaScript code and its behavior.\n--- End of content ---"

            "new_string": "# Project: Number Parity Checker\n\n## 📝 Overview\n\nThis project checks if a given number is even, odd, or zero. It's a fundamental exercise for learning how to use the modulo operator (`%`) within `if-else if-else` statements.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Any Number:\". Type a number and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see if the number is \"Even number\", \"Odd number\", or \"Zero\".\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var num = +prompt(\"Enter Any Number:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter a number. The `+` sign converts the input string into a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks the parity of `num`:\n    ```javascript\n    if (num == 0) {\n        console.log(\"Zero\");\n    } else if (num % 2 != 0) {\n        console.log(\"Odd number\");\n    } else if (num % 2 == 0) {\n        console.log(\"Even number\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   First, it checks if the number is exactly `0`.\n    -   If not, it checks if the remainder when divided by 2 is not 0 (`num % 2 != 0`), which means the number is odd.\n    -   If the remainder is 0, the number is even.\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `10`, the console will output:\n```\nEven number\n```\nIf you enter `7`, the console will output:\n```\nOdd number\n```\n",

It's an excellent exercise for practicing nested conditions and the logical AND (`&&`) operator within an `if-else if-else` structure.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Year:\". Type a year (e.g., 2024) and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see if the year is a \"Leap year\" or \"Not a leap year\".\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var year = +prompt(\"Enter Year:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter a year. The `+` sign converts the input to a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The logic for determining a leap year is based on the following rules:\n    1. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 400.\n    2. Or, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100.\n\n    This is implemented with the following `if-else if-else` statement:\n    ```javascript\n    if (year % 400 == 0) {\n        console.log(\"Leap year\");\n    } else if (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) {\n        console.log(\"Leap year\");\n    } else {\n        console.log(\"Not a leap year\");\n    }\n    ```\n    - The first condition checks if the year is divisible by 400.\n    - The second condition checks if the year is divisible by 4 AND not divisible by 100.\n    - If neither of these is true, it's not a leap year.\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `2000`, the console will output:\n```\nLeap year\n```\nIf you enter `2024`, the console will output:\n```\nLeap year\n```\nIf you enter `1900`, the console will output:\n```\nNot a leap year\n```\n",

It prompts the user for a username and password and checks them against hardcoded credentials. It's a great introduction to using logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators for authentication logic.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will show two prompts: one for the username and one for the password.\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the login status.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var userName = prompt(\"Enter Your User Name:\");\n    var password = prompt(\"Enter Your Password:\");\n    ```\n    These lines prompt the user for their username and password.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement validates the credentials:\n    ```javascript\n    if ((userName == \"admin\") && (password == \"1234\")) {\n        console.log(\"Login successful\");\n    } else if ((userName != \"admin\") || (password != \"1234\")) {\n        console.log(\"Invalid credentials\");\n    } else if ((userName == '') || (password == '')) {\n        console.log(\"Please enter username and password\");\n    }\n    ```\n    - It first checks if both `userName` is \"admin\" AND `password` is \"1234\".\n    - If not, it checks if either the `userName` is not \"admin\" OR the `password` is not \"1234\".\n    - The last check for empty strings is currently unreachable because the second condition will always catch invalid credentials first. A better structure would be to check for empty inputs first.\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `admin` and `1234`, the console will output:\n```\nLogin successful\n```\nIf you enter `user` and `password`, the console will output:\n```\nInvalid credentials\n```\n",

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It reinforces the concept of mapping numerical scores to categories using `if-else if-else`.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Your Marks:\". Type the marks and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the assigned grade.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var marks = +prompt(\"Enter Your Marks:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter their marks. The `+` sign converts the input to a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks the `marks` and logs the corresponding grade:\n    ```javascript\n    if (marks >= 90) {\n        console.log(\"A\");\n    } else if (marks >= 75) {\n        console.log(\"B\");\n    } else if (marks >= 50) {\n        console.log(\"C\");\n    } else if (marks < 50) {\n        console.log(\"Fail\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   If marks are 90 or above, the grade is \"A\".\n    -   If marks are between 75 and 89, the grade is \"B\".\n    -   If marks are between 50 and 74, the grade is \"C\".\n    -   If marks are below 50, the result is \"Fail\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `92`, the console will output:\n```\nA\n```\nIf you enter `80`, the console will output:\n```\nB\n```\n",

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It's a simple and effective way to learn how to handle time-based conditions.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Hour: (0 to 23)\". Type the current hour and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the appropriate greeting.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var hour = +prompt(\"Enter Hour: (0 to 23)\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter the hour. The `+` sign converts the input to a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks the `hour` and provides a greeting:\n    ```javascript\n    if (hour < 12) {\n        console.log(\"Good Morning\");\n    } else if (hour < 18) {\n        console.log(\"Good Afternoon\");\n    } else if (hour >= 18) {\n        console.log(\"Good Evening\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   If the hour is before 12 (i.e., 0-11), it logs \"Good Morning\".\n    -   If the hour is before 18 (i.e., 12-17), it logs \"Good Afternoon\".\n    -   If the hour is 18 or later (i.e., 18-23), it logs \"Good Evening\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `10`, the console will output:\n```\nGood Morning\n```\nIf you enter `15`, the console will output:\n```\nGood Afternoon\n```\n"

It's a clear and simple example of using `if-else if-else` to enforce rules based on a numerical value (speed).\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Your Speed:\". Type the speed and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the outcome.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var speed = +prompt(\"Enter Your Speed:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter their speed. The `+` sign converts the input to a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks the `speed` and provides a corresponding message:\n    ```javascript\n    if (speed < 60) {\n        console.log(\"Safe driving\");\n    } else if (speed < 80) {\n        console.log(\"Warning: Speed limit approaching\");\n    } else if (speed >= 80) {\n        console.log(\"Speeding violation! Fine imposed\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   If the speed is less than 60, the message is \"Safe driving\".\n    -   If the speed is between 60 and 79, a \"Warning\" is issued.\n    -   If the speed is 80 or more, a \"Speeding violation!\" message is shown.\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `55`, the console will output:\n```\nSafe driving\n```\nIf you enter `75`, the console will output:\n```\nWarning: Speed limit approaching\n```\n"

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It's a good exercise for practicing how to handle sequential, non-overlapping numerical ranges with `if-else if-else`.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Any Number:\". Type a number and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see which range the number belongs to.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var num = +prompt(\"Enter Any Number:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter a number. The `+` sign converts the input to a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks the `num` and identifies its range:\n    ```javascript\n    if (num <= 10) {\n        console.log(\"Between 1 and 10\");\n    } else if (num <= 20) {\n        console.log(\"Between 11 and 20\");\n    } else if (num <= 30) {\n        console.log(\"Between 21 and 30\");\n    } else {\n        console.log(\"Number is out of range\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   If the number is 10 or less, it's considered \"Between 1 and 10\".\n    -   If the number is greater than 10 but 20 or less, it's \"Between 11 and 20\".\n    -   If the number is greater than 20 but 30 or less, it's \"Between 21 and 30\".\n    -   Any number greater than 30 is \"out of range\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `7`, the console will output:\n```\nBetween 1 and 10\n```\nIf you enter `25`, the console will output:\n```\nBetween 21 and 30\n```\n"

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

            "new_string": "# Project: Age Verification\n\n## 📝 Overview\n\nThis project classifies a person as an \"Adult\", \"Teenager\", or \"Child\" based on their age. It's a simple age-based categorization task that highlights a potential logic flaw in the `if-else if-else` sequence.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Your Age:\". Type an age and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the age category.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var age = +prompt(\"Enter Your Age:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter their age. The `+` sign converts the input to a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks the `age`:\n    ```javascript\n    if (age >= 18) {\n        console.log(\"Adult\");\n    } else if (age < 17) {\n        console.log(\"Teenager\");\n    } else if (age < 13) {\n        console.log(\"ChildF\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   If the age is 18 or greater, it logs \"Adult\".\n    -   If the age is less than 17, it logs \"Teenager\".\n    -   **Note**: The third condition `age < 13` is currently unreachable. Any age less than 13 is also less than 17, so the second condition will always execute first. To fix this, the order of checks should be from smallest to largest (e.g., check for `< 13` first). The \"ChildF\" seems to be a typo and should be \"Child\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `25`, the console will output:\n```\nAdult\n```\nIf you enter `16`, the console will output:\n```\nTeenager\n```\n",

NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It's a great exercise for practicing the logical AND (`&&`) operator to check multiple conditions simultaneously.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter a Number:\". Type a number and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the classification of the number.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var num = +prompt(\"Enter a Number:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter a number. The `+` sign converts the input string into a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement uses the `&&` operator to check two conditions at once:\n    ```javascript\n    if ((num > 0) && (num % 2 == 0)) {\n        console.log(\"Even and Positive number\");\n    } else if ((num < 0) && (num % 2 == 0)) {\n        console.log(\"Even but Negative number\");\n    } else if (num % 2 != 0) {\n        console.log(\"Odd number\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   The first condition checks if the number is greater than 0 AND has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2 (is even).\n    -   The second condition checks if the number is less than 0 AND is even.\n    -   The final condition checks if the number is odd.\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `10`, the console will output:\n```\nEven and Positive number\n```\nIf you enter `-4`, the console will output:\n```\nEven but Negative number\n```\n",

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It's a practical example of using the logical AND (`&&`) operator to ensure multiple conditions are met.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will prompt you for your age and then your citizenship.\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see your eligibility status.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var age = +prompt(\"Enter Your Age:\");\n    var citizen = prompt(\"Enter Your Citizenship:\");\n    ```\n    These lines prompt the user for their age and citizenship.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement uses the `&&` operator to check both age and citizenship:\n    ```javascript\n    if ((age >= 18) && (citizen == \"Pakistan\")) {\n        console.log(\"Eligible to vote\");\n    } else if ((age < 18) && (citizen == \"Pakistan\")) {\n        console.log(\"Not eligible to vote\");\n    } else if (citizen != \"Pakistan\") {\n        console.log(\"Not eligible due to citizenship\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   The first condition checks if the age is 18 or over AND citizenship is \"Pakistan\".\n    -   The second condition checks if the age is less than 18 AND citizenship is \"Pakistan\".\n    -   The third condition catches any case where citizenship is not \"Pakistan\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter age `25` and citizenship `Pakistan`, the console will output:\n```\nEligible to vote\n```\nIf you enter age `17` and citizenship `Pakistan`, the console will output:\n```\nNot eligible to vote\n```\n"

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It uses the logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators to handle multiple criteria: age range and student status.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will prompt for your age and then your student status (\"yes\" or \"no\").\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the result.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var age = +prompt(\"Enter Your Age:\");\n    var studentStatus = prompt(\"Enter Your Student Status: (yes, no)\");\n    ```\n    These lines get the user's age and student status.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks multiple conditions:\n    ```javascript\n    if ((age >= 13) && (age <= 19) && (studentStatus == \"yes\")) {\n        console.log(\"Teenager and Student\");\n    } else if ((age >= 13) && (age <= 19) && (studentStatus == \"no\")) {\n        console.log(\"Teenager but not a Student\");\n    } else if (age < 13 || age > 19) {\n        console.log(\"Not a Teenager\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   The first condition checks if the age is between 13 and 19 AND the student status is \"yes\".\n    -   The second condition checks if the age is between 13 and 19 AND the student status is \"no\".\n    -   The third condition checks if the person is younger than 13 OR older than 19.\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter age `16` and status `yes`, the console will output:\n```\nTeenager and Student\n```\nIf you enter age `18` and status `no`, the console will output:\n```\nTeenager but not a Student\n```\n",

If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

This is a common bug and should be `membership == \"None\"`.

It's a more complex example that involves breaking down a problem into smaller parts and then combining the results.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will prompt you to \"Enter Your Password:\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see if the password is \"Strong\", \"Weak\", or \"Password too short\".\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var password = prompt(\"Enter Your Password:\");\n    ```\n    This line gets the password from the user.\n\n-   **Checking for Uppercase and Numbers**:\n    The script uses a long series of `||` (OR) conditions to check for the presence of any uppercase letter and any number.\n    ```javascript\n    if (password.includes(\"A\") || ... || password.includes(\"Z\")) {\n        hasUpper = true;\n    }\n    if (password.includes(\"0\") || ... || password.includes(\"9\")) {\n        hasNum = true;\n    }\n    ```\n    **Note**: A more efficient way to do this would be to use regular expressions.\n\n-   **Final Validation**:\n    The final `if-else if-else` statement checks the password's length and the boolean flags `hasUpper` and `hasNum`:\n    ```javascript\n    if ((password.length >= 8) && (hasUpper == true) && (hasNum == true)) {\n        console.log(\"Strong password\");\n    } else if ((password.length >= 8) && (hasUpper == false) && (hasNum == false)) {\n        console.log(\"Weak password\");\n    } else if (password.length < 8) {\n        console.log(\"Password too short\");\n    }\n    ```\n    - A password is \"Strong\" if it's at least 8 characters long and contains both an uppercase letter and a number.\n    - It's \"Weak\" if it's long enough but is missing both an uppercase letter and a number.\n    - It's \"too short\" if it has fewer than 8 characters.\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `Password123`, the console will output:\n```\nStrong password\n```\nIf you enter `password`, the console will output:\n```\nWeak password\n```\n",

It uses both logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators to handle different temperature ranges, but contains a logical flaw in its conditions.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will prompt you to \"Enter Temperature:\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the clothing recommendation.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var temperature = +prompt(\"Enter Temperature:\");\n    ```\n    This line gets the temperature from the user.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks the temperature:\n    ```javascript\n    if ((temperature < 0) || (temperature > -35)) {\n        console.log(\"Wear heavy clothes\");\n    } else if ((temperature >= 0) && (temperature <= 20)) {\n        console.log(\"Wear a jacket\");\n    } else if ((temperature > 20) && (temperature <= 35)) {\n        console.log(\"Wear light clothes\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   **Note**: The first condition `(temperature < 0) || (temperature > -35)` has a logical error. Since every number is either less than 0 or greater than -35, this condition will almost always be true (except for the numbers between -35 and 0, which are also covered). This means the other conditions are unlikely to be checked. It should likely use `&&` to define a range for extreme cold.\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `10`, the console will output:\n```\nWear heavy clothes\n```\n(This is due to the logical flaw. It should be \"Wear a jacket\".)\n\nIf you enter `-40`, the console will output:\n```\nWear heavy clothes\n```\n",

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It's a clear, real-world example of using the logical AND (`&&`) operator to validate multiple requirements.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will prompt for your age and then your license status (\"Yes\" or \"No\").\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see your driving eligibility.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var age = +prompt(\"Enter Your Age:\");\n    var licenseStatus = prompt(\"Enter Your License Status: (Yes, No)\");\n    ```\n    These lines get the user's age and license status.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks both conditions:\n    ```javascript\n    if ((age >= 18) && (licenseStatus == \"Yes\")) {\n        console.log(\"Eligible to drive\");\n    } else if ((age < 18) && (licenseStatus == \"Yes\")) {\n        console.log(\"Not eligible to drive by age\");\n    } else if (licenseStatus == \"No\") {\n        console.log(\"You need a license to drive\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   The first condition checks if the age is 18 or over AND the person has a license.\n    -   The second condition checks if the person is under 18, even if they have a license.\n    -   The third condition checks if the person does not have a license, regardless of age.\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter age `20` and license status `Yes`, the console will output:\n```\nEligible to drive\n```\nIf you enter age `17` and license status `Yes`, the console will output:\n```\nNot eligible to drive by age\n```\n"

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It's an excellent example of using both logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators to handle different levels of eligibility (Approved, Pending, Denied).\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will prompt for your salary and then your credit score.\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the loan status.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var salary = +prompt(\"Enter Your Salary\");\n    var creditScore = +prompt(\"Enter Your Credit Score:\");\n    ```\n    These lines get the user's salary and credit score.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks both criteria:\n    ```javascript\n    if ((salary >= 50000) && (creditScore >= 700)) {\n        console.log(\"Loan Approved\");\n    } else if ((salary >= 50000) || (creditScore >= 700)) {\n        console.log(\"Loan Pending\");\n    } else {\n        console.log(\"Loan Denied\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   The loan is \"Approved\" if the salary is at least 50,000 AND the credit score is at least 700.\n    -   The loan is \"Pending\" if either the salary is high enough OR the credit score is high enough, but not both.\n    -   If neither condition is met, the loan is \"Denied\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter a salary of `60000` and a credit score of `750`, the console will output:\n```\nLoan Approved\n```\nIf you enter a salary of `55000` and a credit score of `650`, the console will output:\n```\nLoan Pending\n```\n",

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It provides feedback based on four possible outcomes, making it a great example of a 2x2 matrix of conditions using logical AND (`&&`).\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will prompt for your marks and then your attendance percentage.\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the performance feedback.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var marks = +prompt(\"Enter Your Marks:\");\n    var attendance = +prompt(\"Enter Your Attendance Percentage:)\");\n    ```\n    These lines get the student's marks and attendance.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The `if-else if-else` statement checks the combination of marks and attendance:\n    ```javascript\n    if ((marks >= 75) && (attendance >= 80)) {\n        console.log(\"Good student\");\n    } else if ((marks >= 75) && (attendance < 80)) {\n        console.log(\"Needs to improve attendance\");\n    } else if ((marks < 75) && (attendance >= 80)) {\n        console.log(\"Needs to improve marks\");\n    } else if ((marks < 75) && (attendance < 80)) {\n        console.log(\"Needs improvement in both\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   If marks are high AND attendance is high, the feedback is \"Good student\".\n    -   If marks are high but attendance is low, it recommends improving attendance.\n    -   If marks are low but attendance is high, it recommends improving marks.\n    -   If both are low, it recommends improvement in both.\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter marks `80` and attendance `90`, the console will output:\n```\nGood student\n```\nIf you enter marks `85` and attendance `70`, the console will output:\n```\nNeeds to improve attendance\n```\n"

These exercises demonstrate how to handle scenarios where a condition depends on the outcome of a prior condition.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n-   Understand the concept and syntax of nested `if` statements.\n-   Learn how to create multi-layered logic to solve more intricate problems.\n-   Practice evaluating conditions in a hierarchical manner.\n-   Gain proficiency in structuring code for clarity when dealing with complex conditional flows.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n-   A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).\n-   A strong understanding of basic `if-else if-else` statements and logical operators (`&&`, `||`).\n-   A text editor to view the code.\n\n## Projects Included\n\nThis collection includes several projects to practice nested `if` logic.\n\n*Note: Some exercises in this directory (`05` through `10`) have been set up but do not yet contain JavaScript code. They serve as placeholders for future practice.*\n\n| #   | Project Title                | Description                                                                                                |\n| --- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1   | **Number Classification**    | Classifies a number first by its sign (Positive/Negative) and then by its parity (Even/Odd).               |\n| 2   | **Age Group Classification** | Categorizes a person into Child, Teenager, Adult, or Senior Citizen using nested checks.                   |\n| 3   | **Grade Classification**     | Assigns a grade (A, B, C, or Fail) with nested conditions for finer grading within a range.                |\n| 4   | **Discount Eligibility**     | Determines a discount percentage based on a primary condition (purchase amount) and a secondary one (membership level). |\n| 5   | **Voting Eligibility**       | *(Not yet implemented)*                                                                                    |\n| 6   | **Scholarship Eligibility**  | *(Not yet implemented)*                                                                                    |\n| 7   | **Electricity Bill Calc.**   | *(Not yet implemented)*                                                                                    |\n| 8   | **Login Authentication**     | *(Not yet implemented)*                                                                                    |\n| 9   | **EMI Category Check**       | *(Not yet implemented)*                                                                                    |\n| 10  | **Job Eligibility**          | *(Not yet implemented)*                                                                                    |\n\n## How to Run Any Implemented Exercise\n\n1.  **Navigate to a Project Folder**:\n    Open the directory of an exercise you want to run (e.g., `01_Number_Classification`).\n\n2.  **Open the HTML File**:\n    Double-click the `index.html` file inside the folder.

It's a classic example of using nested `if` statements to handle multiple layers of conditions.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Any Number:\". Type a number and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the classification of the number.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var num = +prompt(\"Enter Any Number:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter a number. The `+` sign converts the input string into a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The nested `if` statements classify the number:\n    ```javascript\n    if (num > 0) {\n        if (num % 2 == 0) {\n            console.log(\"Positive Even number\");\n        } else {\n            console.log(\"Positive Odd number\");\n        }\n    } else if (num < 0) {\n        if (num % 2 == 0) {\n            console.log(\"Negative Even number\");\n        } else {\n            console.log(\"Negative Odd number\");\n        }\n    } else {\n        console.log(\"Zero\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   The outer `if` checks if the number is positive, negative, or zero.\n    -   The inner `if` statements (for positive and negative numbers) then check if the number is even or odd using the modulo operator (`%`).\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `10`, the console will output:\n```\nPositive Even number\n```\nIf you enter `-5`, the console will output:\n```\nNegative Odd number\n```\nIf you enter `0`, the console will output:\n```\nZero\n```\n",

If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It demonstrates how to refine age-based classifications by adding sub-conditions.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will display a prompt asking you to \"Enter Your Age:\". Type an age and click \"OK\".\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the age group classification.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var age = +prompt(\"Enter Your Age:\");\n    ```\n    This line prompts the user to enter their age. The `+` sign converts the input string into a number.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The nested `if` statements classify the age:\n    ```javascript\n    if (age >= 18) {\n        if (age >= 60) {\n            console.log(\"Senior Citizen\");\n        } else if (age < 60) {\n            console.log(\"Adult\");\n        }\n    } else if (age < 18) {\n        if (age >= 13) {\n            console.log(\"Teenager\");\n        } else if (age < 13) {\n            console.log(\"Child\");\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n    -   The outer `if` checks if the person is 18 or older (Adult/Senior) or younger than 18 (Teenager/Child).\n    -   The inner `if` statements then further refine the category within those broad groups.\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `70`, the console will output:\n```\nSenior Citizen\n```\nIf you enter `25`, the console will output:\n```\nAdult\n```\nIf you enter `15`, the console will output:\n```\nTeenager\n```\n",

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It's a practical example of using nested `if` statements to apply tiered discounts based on multiple criteria.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will prompt for your purchase amount and then your membership level.\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the applicable discount.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var purchaseAmount = +prompt(\"Enter Your Purchase Amount:\");\n    var membership = prompt(\"Enter Your Membership: (Gold, Silver, Bronze)\");\n    ```\n    These lines get the user's purchase amount and membership level.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The nested `if` statements determine the discount:\n    ```javascript\n    if (purchaseAmount >= 5000) {\n        if (membership == \"Gold\") {\n            console.log(\"20% discount\");\n        } else if (membership == \"Silver\") {\n            console.log(\"15% discount\");\n        } else if (membership == \"Bronze\") {\n            console.log(\"10% discount\");\n        }\n    } else if (purchaseAmount < 5000) {\n        if (membership == \"Gold\") {\n            console.log(\"5% discount\");\n        } else if (membership == \"Silver\") {\n            console.log(\"3% discount\");\n        } else if (membership == \"Bronze\") {\n            console.log(\"No discount\");\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n    -   The outer `if` checks if the `purchaseAmount` is ₹5000 or more.\n    -   The inner `if` statements then apply discounts based on the `membership` level.\n    -   If the `purchaseAmount` is less than ₹5000, a different set of discounts is applied based on membership.\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter `6000` and `Gold`, the console will output:\n```\n20% discount\n```\nIf you enter `3000` and `Silver`, the console will output:\n```\n3% discount\n```\n",

It uses nested `if` statements to first check the age requirement and then the nationality requirement.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will prompt for your age and then your nationality.\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see your voting eligibility status.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var age = +prompt(\"Enter Your Age:\");\n    var nationality = prompt(\"Enter Your Nationality:\");\n    ```\n    These lines get the user's age and nationality.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The nested `if` statements check the eligibility:\n    ```javascript\n    if (age >= 18) {\n        if (nationality == \"Pakistan\") {\n            console.log(\"Eligible to vote\");\n        } else if (nationality != \"Pakistan\") {\n            console.log(\"Not Eligible due to nationality\");\n        }\n    } else if (age < 18) {\n        console.log(\"Not eligible to vote\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   The outer `if` checks if the `age` is 18 or greater.\n    -   If the age condition is met, the inner `if` then checks if the `nationality` is \"Pakistan\".\n    -   If the age is less than 18, the person is immediately deemed \"Not eligible to vote\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter age `25` and nationality `Pakistan`, the console will output:\n```\nEligible to vote\n```\nIf you enter age `20` and nationality `India`, the console will output:\n```\nNot Eligible due to nationality\n```\n",

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It uses nested `if` statements to apply a two-stage check for eligibility.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will prompt for your marks and then your family income.\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see your scholarship eligibility status.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var marks = +prompt(\"Enter Your Marks:\");\n    var familyIncome = +prompt(\"Enter Your Family Income:\");\n    ```\n    These lines get the student's marks and family income.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The nested `if` statements check the eligibility:\n    ```javascript\n    if (marks >= 85) {\n        if (familyIncome < 500000) {\n            console.log(\"Eligible for Scholarship\");\n        } else if (familyIncome >= 500000) {\n            console.log(\"Not eligible due to high family income\");\n        }\n    } else if (marks < 85) {\n        console.log(\"Not eligible for Scholarship\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   The outer `if` checks if the `marks` are 85 or greater.\n    -   If the marks condition is met, the inner `if` then checks if the `familyIncome` is less than 500,000.\n    -   If marks are below 85, the student is immediately deemed \"Not eligible for Scholarship\".\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter marks `90` and family income `400000`, the console will output:\n```\nEligible for Scholarship\n```\nIf you enter marks `90` and family income `600000`, the console will output:\n```\nNot eligible due to high family income\n```\n",

It first checks the username and then, if the username is correct, proceeds to check the password. This demonstrates a common pattern for sequential validation.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will prompt for a username and then a password.\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see the login status.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var userName = prompt(\"Enter Your User Name:\");\n    var password = prompt(\"Enter Your Password:\");\n    ```\n    These lines get the username and password from the user.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The nested `if` statements handle the authentication:\n    ```javascript\n    if (userName == \"admin\") {\n        if (password == \"admin123\") {\n            console.log(\"Login successful\");\n        } else {\n            console.log(\"Incorrect password\");\n        }\n    } else {\n        console.log(\"Incorrect username\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   The outer `if` checks if the `userName` is \"admin\".\n    -   If the username is correct, the inner `if` then checks if the `password` is \"admin123\".\n    -   If the username is incorrect, it immediately logs \"Incorrect username\" without checking the password.\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter username `admin` and password `admin123`, the console will output:\n```\nLogin successful\n```\nIf you enter username `admin` and password `wrongpass`, the console will output:\n```\nIncorrect password\n```\n",

Follow the instructions in the prompt or on the page.\n3.  The result will be logged to the browser's console.\n",

It uses nested `if` statements to first validate the input and then perform the BMI calculation and categorization.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will prompt for your height and then your weight.\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see your BMI category or an \"Invalid input\" message.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var height = +prompt(\"Enter Your Height:\");\n    var weight = +prompt(\"Enter Your Weight:\");\n    ```\n    These lines get the user's height and weight.\n\n-   **BMI Calculation**:\n    ```javascript\n    var bmi = weight / (height ** 2);\n    ```\n    This calculates the BMI using the formula: weight / (height * height).\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The nested `if` statements handle input validation and BMI categorization:\n    ```javascript\n    if ((height > 0) && weight > 0) {\n        if (bmi < 18.5) {\n            console.log(\"Underweight\");\n        } else if ((bmi >= 18.5) && (bmi < 25)) {\n            console.log(\"Normal weight\");\n        } else if (bmi >= 25) {\n            console.log(\"Overweight\");\n        }\n    } else if ((height <= 0) || (window <= 0)) { // Note: 'window' should likely be 'weight'\n        console.log(\"Invalid input\");\n    }\n    ```\n    -   The outer `if` checks if both `height` and `weight` are positive.\n    -   If valid, the inner `if` statements categorize the calculated `bmi`.\n    -   **Note**: There's a typo in the `else if` condition: `(window <= 0)` should likely be `(weight <= 0)`. As written, `window <= 0` will always be false in a browser environment.\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter height `1.75` and weight `70`, the console will output:\n```\nNormal weight\n```\nIf you enter height `0` and weight `70`, the console will output:\n```\nInvalid input\n```\n",

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

It's a practical application of nested `if` statements to match candidates to roles.\n\n## 🚀 How to Use\n\n1.  **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.\n2.  **Provide Input**: The browser will prompt for your years of experience and then your skill level (\"beginner\", \"intermediate\", or \"advanced\").\n3.  **See the Result**: Open the browser's developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` and click the \"Console\" tab) to see your job eligibility.\n\n## 💻 Code Explanation\n\nThe core logic is in the `script.js` file.\n\n-   **Getting User Input**:\n    ```javascript\n    var experience = prompt(\"Enter Your Experience:\");\n    var skills = prompt(\"Enter Your Skills: (beginner, intermediate, advanced)\");\n    ```\n    These lines get the user's experience and skills.\n\n-   **Conditional Logic**:\n    The nested `if` statements determine job eligibility:\n    ```javascript\n    if (experience >= 5) {\n        if (skills == \"advanced\") {\n            console.log(\"Eligible for senior position\");\n        } else if (skills == \"intermediate\") {\n            console.log(\"Eligible for mid-level position\");\n        }\n    } else if (experience < 5) {\n        if (skills == \"beginner\") {\n            console.log(\"Eligible for entry-level position\");\n        } else if (skills == \"intermediate\") {\n            console.log(\"Eligible for mid-level position\");\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n    -   The outer `if` checks if `experience` is 5 years or more.\n    -   If so, the inner `if` checks for \"advanced\" or \"intermediate\" skills for senior/mid-level positions.\n    -   If experience is less than 5 years, a different set of inner `if` statements checks for \"beginner\" or \"intermediate\" skills for entry-level/mid-level positions.\n\n## ✨ Example\n\nIf you enter experience `7` and skills `advanced`, the console will output:\n```\nEligible for senior position\n```\nIf you enter experience `3` and skills `intermediate`, the console will output:\n```\nEligible for mid-level position\n```\n",

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

These are `if` statements placed inside other `if` or `else` blocks, allowing for more complex, multi-level conditional logic. These exercises demonstrate how to handle scenarios where a condition depends on the outcome of a prior condition.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n-   Understand the concept and syntax of nested `if` statements.\n-   Learn how to create multi-layered logic to solve more intricate problems.\n-   Practice evaluating conditions in a hierarchical manner.\n-   Gain proficiency in structuring code for clarity when dealing with complex conditional flows.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n-   A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).\n-   A strong understanding of basic `if-else if-else` statements and logical operators (`&&`, `||`).\n-   A text editor to view the code.\n\n## Projects Included\n\nThis collection includes several projects to practice nested `if` logic.\n\n*Note: Some exercises in this directory (`05` through `10`) have been set up but do not yet contain JavaScript code. They serve as placeholders for future practice.*\n\n| #   | Project Title                | Description                                                                                                |\n| --- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1   | **Number Classification**    | Classifies a number first by its sign (Positive/Negative) and then by its parity (Even/Odd).               |\n| 2   | **Age Group Classification** | Categorizes a person into Child, Teenager, Adult, or Senior Citizen using nested checks.                   |\n| 3   | **Grade Classification**     | Assigns a grade (A, B, C, or Fail) with nested conditions for finer grading within a range.                |\n| 4   | **Discount Eligibility**     | Determines a discount percentage based on a primary condition (purchase amount) and a secondary one (membership level). |\n| 5   | **Voting Eligibility**       | *(Not yet implemented)*                                                                                    |\n| 6   | **Scholarship Eligibility**  | *(Not yet implemented)*                                                                                    |\n| 7   | **Electricity Bill Calc.**   | *(Not yet implemented)*                                                                                    |\n| 8   | **Login Authentication**     | *(Not yet implemented)*                                                                                    |\n| 9   | **EMI Category Check**       | *(Not yet implemented)*                                                                                    |\n| 10  | **Job Eligibility**          | *(Not yet implemented)*                                                                                    |\n\n## How to Run Any Implemented Exercise\n\n1.  **Navigate to a Project Folder**:\n    Open the directory of an exercise you want to run (e.g., `01_Number_Classification`).\n\n2.  **Open the HTML File**:\n    Double-click the `index.html` file inside the folder.

Here’s why it's used:\n\n1.  **Grants Permissions**: By default, all creative work (including code) is under exclusive copyright, meaning no one else can use it without permission. A license explicitly grants those permissions. Without it, others cannot legally use, copy, modify, or share your code.\n\n2.  **Defines Usage Rights**: It tells other developers and users what they are allowed to do with your code. Can they use it in a commercial product? Do they have to share their modifications? The license answers these questions.\n\n3.  **Limits Liability**: Most licenses include a clause stating that the software is provided \"as is,\" without any warranty. This protects the author from being held liable if the code doesn't work correctly or causes problems.\n\n4.  **Enables Open Source Collaboration**: For open-source projects, the license is what makes them \"open.\" It's the legal mechanism that allows for community contributions, forks, and the free exchange of software.\n\nIn short, a `LICENSE` file moves your code from \"All Rights Reserved\" to \"Some Rights Reserved,\" making it legally usable by others and protecting you as the author.",

      "content": "You're right, there are many types of software licenses, each with different terms for how code can be used, modified, and distributed. They generally fall into a few main categories:\n\n1.  **Permissive Licenses**: These are the most flexible, allowing users to do almost anything with the code, including using it in proprietary software, as long as the original copyright notice and license text are included.\n    *   **Examples**:\n        *   **MIT License**: Very short and simple, widely used. Allows reuse for any purpose, provided the license is included.\n        *   **Apache License 2.0**: Similar to MIT but includes patent grants and explicit contributions clauses.\n        *   **BSD Licenses**: A family of licenses that are very permissive, often requiring only attribution.\n\n2.  **Copyleft Licenses**: These licenses aim to ensure that derivative works remain open source. If you modify and distribute software under a copyleft license, you must also release your modifications under the same (or a compatible) copyleft license.\n    *   **Examples**:\n        *   **GNU General Public License (GPL)**: The most well-known copyleft license. It ensures that all modified versions of the software, when distributed, must also be free software.\n        *   **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)**: A weaker form of copyleft, often used for libraries. It allows proprietary software to link to LGPL-licensed libraries without requiring the proprietary software itself to be open source.\n\n3.  **Public Domain / No License**:\n    *   **Public Domain**: Code explicitly placed in the public domain has no copyright restrictions, meaning anyone can do anything with it without attribution or legal obligation.\n    *   **No License**: If a project has no license file, it's typically considered \"all rights reserved\" by default copyright law. This means no one has permission to use, modify, or distribute the code without explicit permission from the copyright holder.\n\nChoosing the right license depends on the project's goals and how the author wants their code to be used and shared.",

      "content": "Yes, it is an excellent and highly recommended practice to include a `LICENSE` file in your projects, especially if you are sharing your code publicly (e.g., on GitHub).\n\nHere’s why it’s not just good, but essential:\n\n1.  **It Provides Legal Clarity**: Without a license, your code is under exclusive copyright by default. This means no one else has the legal right to use, copy, modify, or distribute it. A license explicitly grants these permissions.\n\n2.  **It Encourages Use and Collaboration**: If other developers see a project without a license, they will often avoid it because the legal situation is unclear. By including a license, you are telling others, \"Here is how you can use my work,\" which encourages them to use it, learn from it, and contribute back.\n\n3.  **It Protects You**: A license typically includes a disclaimer of warranty, which helps protect you from liability if your code causes problems for someone else.\n\nEven for small personal projects, adding a license is a good habit. It makes your work truly open and usable by the community. Platforms like GitHub even provide tools to help you choose and add a license file when you create a new repository.",

      "content": "Based on your requirements—that you don't want anyone to change or use your code—the answer is simple: **do not add a license file.**\n\nHere’s why:\n\n1.  **Default Copyright Law**: When you create original work (including code), it is automatically protected by copyright law. This means you have \"All Rights Reserved.\" Without a `LICENSE` file that grants permissions, no one else has the legal right to use, copy, modify, or distribute your code. This perfectly matches your requirements.\n\n2.  **Open Source Licenses Do the Opposite**: Licenses like MIT, Apache, or GPL are designed to *give away* certain rights, allowing others to use and change the code. Since you want to prevent this, you should not use any of them.\n\nTo make your intentions perfectly clear to anyone who views the repository, you can add a statement to the top of your `README.md` file.\n\nHere is a sample text you can add:\n\n```\n## Copyright and Usage\n\n© 2025 [Your Name]. All Rights Reserved.\n\nThis project is for demonstration purposes only. The code is provided for viewing and educational review and is not licensed for use, modification, or distribution in any form.\n```\n\nBy having **no `LICENSE` file** and adding this clear statement, you are making your intentions legally and practically clear.",

If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `file_path` MUST be an absolute path; otherwise an error will be thrown.\n      2. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      3. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      4. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      5. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      6. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** If there are multiple and ambiguous occurences of the `old_string` in the file, the tool will also fail.",

      "content": "Yes, besides a `README.md` and a `LICENSE`, several other files and practices are common in well-maintained GitHub repositories. Here are some of the most important ones:\n\n1.  **`.gitignore` File**\n    *   **What it is**: A file that tells Git which files and folders to intentionally ignore.\n    *   **Why it's important**: It prevents you from accidentally committing unnecessary files like system files (`.DS_Store`), dependency folders (`node_modules`), log files, or secret credentials. This keeps your repository clean and secure.\n\n2.  **`CONTRIBUTING.md` File**\n    *   **What it is**: A guide for potential contributors. It explains how to report bugs, request features, and submit changes to your project.\n    *   **Why it's important**: For open-source projects, it's crucial for encouraging and managing community contributions. For your project, since you don't want contributions, this file could explicitly state that the project is not open for contributions.\n\n3.  **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` File**\n    *   **What it is**: A document that sets the standards for behavior in your project's community to ensure a positive and inclusive environment.\n    *   **Why it's important**: It helps make your project a welcoming space for any potential collaborators or users who might interact with it via issues or discussions.\n\n4.  **Issue and Pull Request Templates**\n    *   **What they are**: Markdown files in a `.github` folder that pre-fill the text box when someone creates a new issue or pull request.\n    *   **Why they are important**: They help you get the specific information you need to understand a bug report or a proposed change, making project management much easier.\n\nFor your current project, a **`.gitignore`** file is the most immediately useful one to add. The others (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`) are excellent practices for projects you intend to share or collaborate on in the future.",
