# Nested `if` Statement Exercises

This directory focuses on exercises that require the use of **nested `if` statements**. These are `if` statements placed inside other `if` or `else` blocks, allowing for more complex, multi-level conditional logic. These exercises demonstrate how to handle scenarios where a condition depends on the outcome of a prior condition.

## Learning Objectives

-   Understand the concept and syntax of nested `if` statements.
-   Learn how to create multi-layered logic to solve more intricate problems.
-   Practice evaluating conditions in a hierarchical manner.
-   Gain proficiency in structuring code for clarity when dealing with complex conditional flows.

## Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
-   A strong understanding of basic `if-else if-else` statements and logical operators (`&&`, `||`).
-   A text editor to view the code.

## Projects Included

This collection includes several projects to practice nested `if` logic.

*Note: Some exercises in this directory (`05` through `10`) have been set up but do not yet contain JavaScript code. They serve as placeholders for future practice.*

## How to Run Any Implemented Exercise

1.  **Navigate to a Project Folder**:
    Open the directory of an exercise you want to run (e.g., `01_Number_Classification`).

2.  **Open the HTML File**:
    Double-click the `index.html` file inside the folder. This will open it in your default web browser.

3.  **Interact with the Prompt(s)**:
    The page will show one or more prompts asking for input. Enter the required information.

4.  **View the Output**:
    -   Right-click on the page and select **"Inspect"** or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac) to open the developer tools.
    -   Click on the **"Console"** tab.
    -   The output of the script will be displayed there.

## What You'll Find in Each Folder

Each project folder contains:

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads the JavaScript code.
-   `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the nested `if` logic.
