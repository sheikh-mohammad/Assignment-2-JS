# `if-else if-else` with Logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) Operators

This directory contains a set of JavaScript exercises specifically designed to demonstrate and practice the use of `if-else if-else` conditional statements in conjunction with logical `AND` (`&&`) and `OR` (`||`) operators. These exercises tackle scenarios where multiple conditions need to be evaluated simultaneously to determine the program's flow.

## Learning Objectives

-   Master the application of logical `AND` (`&&`) and `OR` (`||`) operators within conditional statements.
-   Understand how to construct complex conditional expressions.
-   Improve problem-solving skills by breaking down multi-faceted conditions.
-   Further practice user input handling and console output.

## Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
-   A solid understanding of basic `if-else if-else` statements.
-   Familiarity with JavaScript syntax.
-   A text editor to view the code.

## Projects Included

This collection features 10 projects, each highlighting different ways to use logical operators.

| #   | Project Title                       | Description                                                                                             |
| --- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Even and Positive Number Check**  | Checks if a number is both even and positive, even but negative, or odd.                                |
| 2   | **Eligibility to Vote**             | Determines voting eligibility based on age and citizenship.                                             |
| 3   | **Teenager and Student Check**      | Identifies if a person is a teenager and/or a student based on age and student status.                  |
| 4   | **Discount**                        | Applies a discount based on age and membership type (e.g., Gold, Silver).                               |
| 5   | **Password Validation**             | Validates password strength based on length, presence of uppercase letters, and numbers.                |
| 6   | **Temperature Check**               | Recommends clothing based on temperature ranges, using `OR` for extreme cold.                           |
| 7   | **Driving Age and License Check**   | Checks eligibility to drive based on age and whether a license is held.                                 |
| 8   | **Loan Eligibility**                | Determines loan approval, pending status, or denial based on salary and credit score.                   |
| 9   | **Working Hours and Overtime Pay**  | Calculates if overtime pay is applicable based on working hours and hourly rate.                        |
| 10  | **School Grade Check**              | Evaluates a student's performance based on marks and attendance, identifying areas for improvement.     |

## How to Run Any Exercise

1.  **Navigate to a Project Folder**:
    Open the directory of the exercise you want to run (e.g., `01_Even_and_Positive_Number_Check`).

2.  **Open the HTML File**:
    Double-click the `index.html` file inside the folder. This will open it in your default web browser.

3.  **Interact with the Prompt(s)**:
    The page will show one or more prompts asking for input. Enter the required information (e.g., a number, age, citizenship).

4.  **View the Output**:
    -   Right-click on the page and select **"Inspect"** or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac) to open the developer tools.
    -   Click on the **"Console"** tab.
    -   The output of the script will be displayed there.

## What You'll Find in Each Folder

Each project folder is structured as follows:

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads the JavaScript code.
-   `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the `if-else if-else` logic with logical operators.

This setup allows you to focus on how logical operators enhance conditional branching.
